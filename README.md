aliases and short scripty things

Included are some tidbits I've found interesting, hopefully you might find some useful as well. 
I had a lot of aliases for scripts that pertain specifically to me, which have been rescinded. 
These will eventually be included in separate files or notes.

Now enough README-ing, go do!
